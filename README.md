# Stock_Predictor_WebApp
This project aims to provide users with a comprehensive analysis of selected stocks, including the predicted price, technical analysis plots, and strategy with basic statistics. To achieve this goal, a web application has been developed, which allows users to select specific stocks and dates for analysis. Once the user has selected the desired stock and date range, the app will generate a report that includes all the relevant analysis, such as the predicted price and technical analysis plots. This tool is designed to help investors make informed decisions by providing them with valuable insights and information about their chosen stocks.
